//Logical operators use when we need to check multiple conditions
// && And operater
// || or operater

//example

console.log (10>9 && 8<9);
output: true

//explanation
console.log (10<9 && 8<9 && 18>9);
Output: false

//here if the first condition gets false then it didnt check next condtions
//becauss && what says each and every conditions should be true

//now lets move to or || operator

console.log (10<9 || 15<9 || 17>9);
output: true
//here what is happening in first step that is 10<9 here statment becomes false in next 15<9 also statment becomes false but
// when it reach to 17>9 here we get true so answer becomes true
//explanation
// in this case even one statment becomes true then everything becomes true and even first stament becomes true then no need to check other statments
