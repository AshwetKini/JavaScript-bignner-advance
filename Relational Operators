//there are many relational operators 
> //greater than 
< //less
<= //less equals
>= // greator equals
!= //not equals
= //equals means you are assigning the vaalue
== //double equals check the values from left and right side which are same or not 
=== // triple equals to double equals but always use triple equals see the example below

//relational operators it will give result true or false
// example

console.log (10>5);
output : true

//  js != to this we called not-strict equals and !== strict equals  
//alwasy use !== strict version

//here is the tricky thing you must understand

console.log (10!==10);
output: false

//double and triple equals eg

console.log (13==13); // it will print true 
console.log (13=="13"); // similarly we will pass string STILL it will print TRUE
//that is why we should use triple equals
console.log (13==="13"); 
output : FALSE
